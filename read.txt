Here is the cleanest and simplest way to configure Flask so you can save each file type to its own folder:

✅ Folder Structure You Want
uploads/
    assignments_uploads/
    profile_photo/
    assignment_student_submission_files/

✅ 1. Create the folders automatically

Put this after app = Flask(__name__):

import os

BASE_UPLOAD = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "uploads")
ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD = os.path.join(BASE_UPLOAD, "assignments_uploads")
PROFILE_PHOTO_UPLOAD = os.path.join(BASE_UPLOAD, "profile_photo")
STUDENT_SUBMISSION_UPLOAD = os.path.join(BASE_UPLOAD, "assignment_student_submission_files")

# Create folders if not exist
for folder in [BASE_UPLOAD, ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD, PROFILE_PHOTO_UPLOAD, STUDENT_SUBMISSION_UPLOAD]:
    os.makedirs(folder, exist_ok=True)

✅ 2. Add to Flask config
app.config["BASE_UPLOAD"] = BASE_UPLOAD
app.config["ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD"] = ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD
app.config["PROFILE_PHOTO_UPLOAD"] = PROFILE_PHOTO_UPLOAD
app.config["STUDENT_SUBMISSION_UPLOAD"] = STUDENT_SUBMISSION_UPLOAD

✅ 3. Saving files (example routes)
🎓 Save Assignment Files
@app.route('/upload/assignment', methods=['POST'])
def upload_assignment():
    file = request.files['file']
    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file.save(os.path.join(app.config["ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD"], filename))
    return "Assignment uploaded"

🧑‍🏫 Save Profile Photo
@app.route('/upload/profile', methods=['POST'])
def upload_profile():
    file = request.files['file']
    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file.save(os.path.join(app.config["PROFILE_PHOTO_UPLOAD"], filename))
    return "Profile photo uploaded"

📝 Save Student Assignment Submission
@app.route('/upload/submission', methods=['POST'])
def upload_submission():
    file = request.files['file']
    filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
    file.save(os.path.join(app.config["STUDENT_SUBMISSION_UPLOAD"], filename))
    return "Submission uploaded"

✅ 4. How to store in DB

Example for your model:

new_file = AssignmentFileUpload(
    original_name=file.filename,
    filename=filename,
    filepath=os.path.join(app.config["ASSIGNMENT_UPLOAD"], filename)
)
db.session.add(new_file)
db.session.commit()

💬 If You Want I Can:

✔ Create download route
✔ Add file validation (PDF/images only)
✔ Add unique filename generator
✔ Integrate with your Assignment model

Just tell me “show full working code” — and I’ll write everything perfectly structured.
